## About me

Coding as a hobbyist 👨‍💻  

Programming languages I am (kind of) familiar with
- Java: mainly for testing and playing around, the language I am most experienced in
- Python: for controlling hardware (using some hacky Raspberry Pi setup)
- just got started with Dart/Flutter targeting mobile devices
